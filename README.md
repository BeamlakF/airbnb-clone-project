## Team Roles

This project simulates a professional software development environment. Below are the typical team roles involved, based on standard practices and the ITRexGroup blog. Currently, all responsibilities are handled individually.

###  Backend Developer  
Responsible for building and maintaining API endpoints, implementing authentication, business logic, and handling user interactions.

###  Database Administrator (DBA)  
Designs and manages database schemas, ensures data integrity, creates indexes for performance, and maintains backups and optimization.

###  DevOps Engineer  
Sets up Docker containers, manages deployment pipelines, configures environment variables, handles system monitoring, and ensures high availability.

###  QA Engineer  
Writes and runs automated and manual tests to ensure feature reliability, tracks bugs, and validates that new code meets project standards.

##  Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used to develop the main server-side logic and RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Simplifies the creation of robust REST APIs by providing serialization, views, and authentication tools.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system used for storing and querying structured data like users, bookings, and properties.
- **GraphQL**: Offers a flexible and efficient way for clients to query only the data they need, improving performance and developer experience.
- **Celery**: Manages background tasks such as sending email notifications or processing asynchronous jobs like payments.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data store used for caching, improving API response times, and managing Celery task queues.
- **Docker**: Enables containerization of the entire app, ensuring consistent development, testing, and production environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automatically runs tests and deploys code to ensure fast, safe integration of changes.

##  Database Design

This project uses a relational database to manage various entities and their relationships. 

###  Users
Represents both guests and hosts in the platform.
- `id`: Unique identifier for each user.
- `name`: Full name of the user.
- `email`: Userâ€™s email address (used for login).
- `role`: Indicates if the user is a guest or host.
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the user account was created.

ðŸ”— **Relationships**:
- A user can list multiple properties (host).
- A user can make multiple bookings (guest).
- A user can leave multiple reviews.

---

###  Properties
Represents rental listings on the platform.
- `id`: Unique identifier for each property.
- `title`: Property name or title.
- `description`: Details about the property.
- `price_per_night`: Cost of booking per night.
- `owner_id`: References the user who owns the property.

ðŸ”— **Relationships**:
- A property belongs to one user (host).
- A property can have multiple bookings and reviews.

---

###  Bookings
Represents reservations made by users.
- `id`: Unique identifier for the booking.
- `property_id`: References the booked property.
- `user_id`: References the user who made the booking.
- `start_date`: Check-in date.
- `end_date`: Check-out date.

ðŸ”— **Relationships**:
- A booking belongs to one user and one property.
- A booking can have one associated payment.

---

###  Payments
Represents transactions for bookings.
- `id`: Unique identifier for the payment.
- `booking_id`: References the associated booking.
- `amount`: Total paid.
- `status`: Payment status (e.g., completed, pending).
- `timestamp`: When the payment was made.

ðŸ”— **Relationships**:
- A payment is linked to a single booking.

---

###  Reviews
User feedback for properties.
- `id`: Unique identifier for the review.
- `user_id`: References the user who wrote the review.
- `property_id`: References the reviewed property.
- `rating`: Score given by the user.
- `comment`: Text review.

ðŸ”— **Relationships**:
- A review belongs to one user and one property.

---

###  Database Optimizations

- **Indexing**: Applied to frequently queried fields such as `user_id`, `property_id`, and `booking_id` for faster lookup.
- **Caching**: Redis is used to cache frequent read operations like listing properties or retrieving user profiles to reduce database load and improve performance.
